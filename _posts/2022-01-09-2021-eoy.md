花样的年华 月样的精神 / 冰雪样的聪明 / \n
募地里这孤岛 笼罩着惨雾愁云 / 惨雾愁云 / \n
几时我 能见那雾消云散 / 重见你 放出光明

In full disclosure, my 2021 was messy, confusing, and depressing. For some reason, the lyrics match well with my state of mind. Looking back, I kept wondering if I could have done 2021 better. I mean, I moved to a new country; I started a PhD program, finally. There was so much potential, and my year was just...blank.

To be fair, it wasn't entirely blank, but it felt like it. I was so depressed, so drunk, and so lost. I walked down the street at 1 am by myself, with tears streaming down my face. I sat by the lake, smoking, and staring into space.
