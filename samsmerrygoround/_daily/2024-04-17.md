	今天得到的几个非常有力量的信息：
	
	1.Rejection is inherent, and that is okay. Try letting others accept only parts of you and just sit with it.
	
	2.It's also not possible to accept someone else 100%, and that is okay, too. It's meaningless to accept someone if you disappear in the process. You have to be present with your feelings and needs too to be able to accept others' needs and feelings.
	
	3.It's okay to be open to other people's ideas, but you still need to trust yourself and know what you want.
	
	感觉是比较相关的几点。归根结底还是要相信且追求自己的需求。
